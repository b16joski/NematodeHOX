# NEMATODA_HOX_PROJECT_2023

## Revisiting Hox gene evolution, and Hox cluster linkage across Nematoda

### Context

Hox genes occupy a prime position towards our understanding of metazoan body plan formation, patterning and evolution. They play a critical role early on in embryonic development in deciding what cells should become so that the correct body parts are formed in the right places from nematodes to vertebrates. Here we have re-visited the Hox gene complements of Nematoda not only to understand the evolution of this key set of body pattern genes using newly available high-quality genomes but also to classify the loci into their ortholog groups as well as look for linkage between loci in a broader phylogenetic context.
